## RUST - Programming Language

### Definition of Requirements

> Software Requirements is a field within software engineering that deals with establishing the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software. The IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Technology defines a software requirement as:

>> 1. A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective; 

>> 2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document;

>> 3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2.

As said above, requirements are conditions that the costumer wants the software to have before it is delivered.

### RUST's requirements

1. To be a fast systems programming language;
2. Guarantee memory safety;
3. To be a good language for creating highly concurrent and highly safe systems.
