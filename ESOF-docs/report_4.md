## Introduction


## Testability 

The testability of software components (modules, classes) is determined by factors such as:
- Controllability: The degree to which it is possible to control the state of the component under test (CUT) as required for testing.
- Observability: The degree to which it is possible to observe (intermediate and final) test results.
- Isolateability: The degree to which the component under test (CUT) can be tested in isolation.
- Separation of concerns: The degree to which the component under test has a single, well defined responsibility.
- Understandability: The degree to which the component under test is documented or self-explaining.
- Heterogeneity: The degree to which the use of diverse technologies requires to use diverse test methods and tools in parallel.
