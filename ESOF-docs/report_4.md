## Introduction


## Testability 

The testability of software components (modules, classes) is determined by factors such as:
- Controllability: The degree to which it is possible to control the state of the component under test (CUT) as required for testing.
- Observability: The degree to which it is possible to observe (intermediate and final) test results.
- Isolateability: The degree to which the component under test (CUT) can be tested in isolation.
- Separation of concerns: The degree to which the component under test has a single, well defined responsibility.
- Understandability: The degree to which the component under test is documented or self-explaining.
- Heterogeneity: The degree to which the use of diverse technologies requires to use diverse test methods and tools in parallel.

By talking with some contributtors to the **Rust Project** and by reading the **Test** chapter on **Rust** blog we learned that Rust turns very easy a test driven approach and that the language lends itself well to testing because:
- The compiler performs the heavy lifting when it comes to common bugs, so we can focus on other things;
- The language as a good match with unitary tests which leads to easily composable code;
- Its easy to maintain coverage and to deploying the service;
